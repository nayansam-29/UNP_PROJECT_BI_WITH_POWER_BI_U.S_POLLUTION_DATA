# UNP_PROJECT_BI_WITH_POWER_BI_U.S._POLLUTION_DATA

During my internship with United Network of Professionals (UNP Education), I developed an interactive Power BI dashboard titled "U.S. Air Pollution Analysis" to evaluate air pollution trends from 2000 to 2016, focusing on key pollutants such as NO2, CO, O3, and SO2. The dashboard features dynamic visualizations, geographical heatmaps, and time-series analyses to identify pollution patterns and provide actionable insights for mitigating air pollution across U.S. states and cities. This project enhanced my skills in data cleaning, transformation, and visualization, while deepening my understanding of environmental data analytics. All project files, including datasets and Power BI reports, have been published on GitHub for transparency and further development, showcasing my ability to transform complex data into actionable insights for informed decision-making.
